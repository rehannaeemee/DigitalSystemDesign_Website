      This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of digital system design. 
      It covers the analysis, design, and implementation of digital circuits and systems using modern design methodologies. 
      Students will study combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, timing analysis, and basic computer arithmetic. 
      Emphasis is placed on hardware description languages (HDLs) for modeling, simulation, and synthesis of digital systems.

The course also introduces programmable logic devices such as FPGAs and discusses design constraints related to performance, area, power, and reliability. Through lectures, laboratory exercises, and design projects, students will gain hands-on experience in developing, verifying, and implementing digital systems, preparing them for advanced studies and practical work in computer engineering, embedded systems, and microprocessor-based design.
